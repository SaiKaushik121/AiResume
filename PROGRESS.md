# Project Progress & Features Documentation

## Overview
This project is a fully responsive, modern React AI-powered resume builder with multi-step forms, dynamic sections, and localStorage persistence. It integrates the Gemini API to generate a structured JSON output for resume, skill gap analysis, learning resources, and interview Q&A. The UI clearly distinguishes AI-generated vs user-provided content.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Responsive Multi-Step Form
- **Personal Details, Education, Skills, Certifications, Job Match**: Each step is a separate, fully responsive form component.
- **Form Centering**: All forms are centered on desktop and mobile using Tailwind utility classes (`max-w-3xl w-full mx-auto`).
- **Add/Remove Dynamic Sections**: Education, Certifications, Awards, and Projects support dynamic add/remove with correct button logic ("Remove" never shown for the first item).
- **Progress Bar**: (Component stub present, ready for enhancement.)

### 2. AI Integration
- **Gemini API**: Integrated for resume generation, skill gap analysis, learning resources, and interview Q&A.
- **Prompt Design**: Only AI-generated content is marked with `"source": "ai"` in the JSON output.
- **Results Page**: Renders all sections responsively, with clear formatting and distinction between user and AI content.

### 3. UI/UX & Responsiveness
- **Homepage Hero Section**: Modern, visually appealing, and fully responsive. Hero buttons are mobile-optimized and never overflow the background.
- **Button Sizing**: All main action buttons are sized for mobile and desktop, with proper spacing and padding.
- **Form Layouts**: All forms use consistent spacing, readable widths, and mobile-first design.
- **Section Containers**: All main content is wrapped in a responsive container for perfect centering.

### 4. Data Persistence
- **localStorage**: All form data is saved and loaded from localStorage, allowing users to resume progress.

### 5. Navigation
- **Multi-step Navigation**: Users can move back and forth between steps. Navigation buttons are always visible and responsive.
